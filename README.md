CSE185_Advanced_Bioinformatics_Laboratory 

Lab assignments completed at UCSD while enrolled in an undergraduate course "CSE 185 Advanced Bioinformatics Laboratory". The course description is given below.

This course emphasizes the hands-on application of bioinformatics to biological problems. Students will gain experience in the application of existing software, as well as in combining approaches to answer specific biological questions. Sequence alignment, fast database search, comparative genomics, expression analysis, computational proteomics, genome-wide association studies, next generation sequencing, genomics and big data. 

### Course Objectives

* Be able to explain why bioinformatics approaches are important to understand and interpret results in many different biological areas of study.
* Be able to utilize existing bioinformatics tools individually and in combination to analyze various kinds of biological data.
* Develop critical analysis and research skills that can be applied to understand and use new bioinformatics tools that are developed in the future.
* Be able to access publicly available datasets and bioinformatics tools.
* Learn and use accepted best practices for bioinformatics.
