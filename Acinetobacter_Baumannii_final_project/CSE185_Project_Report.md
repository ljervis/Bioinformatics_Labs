# Investigation into _Acinetobacter Baumannii_ biofilm production using differential gene expression analysis and functional gene annotation of biofilm and planktonic cells

## Abstract

*Acinetobacter Baumannii* is a bacterium commonly found in modern hospital environments. It is a source of severe hospital born infections and the prevalence of multi drug resistant strains is on the rise. *A. baumannii* has the ability to become sessile and form protective biofilms allowing it to persist on abiotic surfaces for extended periods of time. Formation of these biofilms also increases their resistance to many common antimicrobial compounds. The formation of biofilms is a complicated biological process that is currently under investigation. In this study we compare the mRNA transcriptome expression profiles of free floating planktonic cells and biofilm forming sessile cells to gain insight into the genes responsible for biofilm formation. We found 103 differentially expressed genes. 42 genes were up regulated and 61 genes were down regulated in biofilm vs planktonic cells.  

## Introduction

*Acinetobacter Baumannii* is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that has recently made its way into the medical spotlight. This infamy stems from *A. Baumanniis* ability to develop resistance to many of the currently available antibiotics. Compounding this is *A. Baumanniis* surprising resilience and survivability on many abiotic surfaces present in hospital environments (1.). Infections from this pathogen are becoming increasingly common in immunocompromised hospital patients. The World Health Organization identified microbial resistance as one of the most serious contemporary human health problems (2.). Novel therapeutics are needed to effectively deal with these resistant strains. The use of RNA-sequencing experiments has potential to increase our understanding of how drug resistance is conferred in *A. Baumannnii* and help identify therapeutic targets.  

Like many bacteria, *A Baumannii* aggregate on surfaces and form sessile communities covered by biofilms. Biofilms allow the bacteria to persist in hostile environments such as on the surface of medical devices where planktonic cells would not survive. Furthermore bacterial biofilms are inherently resistant to antimicrobial agents. Studies have shown that *A. Baumannii* is sensitive to the antimicrobial agent Tigecycline when in a planktonic form. When *A. Baumannii* becomes sessile in a biofilm environment, the effects of Tigecycline are greatly diminished (3.). Until recently surprisingly little was known about the molecular and genetic basis of biofilm formation. New molecular techniques such as RNA-sequencing can give us insight into what genes are involved in the complex process of biofilm formation. 

In this study we compare the mRNA transcriptome of planktonic and sessile biofilm covered *A. Baumannii ATCC 17978* cells. Differential gene expression analysis was preformed to identify genes that are over or under expressed in biofilm forming cells compared to planktonic cells. Functional analysis was then preformed to uncover biological insight into how the differential expression of these genes may contribute to the formation of biofilms. We hope this knowledge can serve as a basis to direct future studies on the mechanisms that make *A. Baumanii* such a opportunistic and resilient bacterial pathogen.

The RNA-seq and annotation data used in this study came from a similar study by Rumbo-Feal et al. (4.) and was deposited into NCBI's SRA database. In Rumbo-Feal's study differential expression analysis was performed using a different bioinformatics pipeline to the one used in this study.

## Methods

### Overview of bioinformatics pipeline

1. Fastqc (read quality analysis) (5.) 
2. Sickle (read trimming) (6.)
3. Cufflinks gffread (generation of transcriptome file) (7.)
4. Kallisto (quantification of transcript abundance) (8.)
5. Sleuth (differential expression analysis) (9.)
6. BioCyc (Functional Annotation) (10.)

### RNA Sequencing Data

RNA sequencing data was obtained from the SRA database under the Bioproject accession number PRJNA191863. The data came from a 2013 study by Rumbo-Feal et al (4.) in which planktonic and sessile *A. Baumannii* cells were cultured and their transcriptomes sequenced using Illuminas HiScanSQ sequencer. The data set contained two biological replicates for each condition with further details shown in Table 1.

#### Table 1 RNA-Seq Data 
| Type | Replicate | Accession Number | File Format | File Size | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stationary | 1 | SRX263970 | fasta | 173.2Mb |
| Stationary | 2 | SRX263972 | fasta | 143.6Mb |
| Sessile | 1 | SRX263965 | fasta | 208.9Mb |
| Sessile | 2 | SRX263968 | fasta | 54.8Mb |

### Quality Control 

Fasta files were downloaded and paired end reads separated using the SRA toolkit with the --split-files option. FastQC (5.) was used for inspection of read quality. HTML files displaying the results of the fastqc analysis can be found in the Fastqc folder. The reads were trimmed with Sickle (6.) with default settings. Details can be found in Table 2. 

### Differential Expression Analysis

Kallisto (8.) was used to quantify gene expression. Kallisto requires an indexed transcriptome. A genome annotation file for *A. Baumannii* was downloaded (NCBI Reference Sequence NC_009085.1) in gff3 format. A tool included in the Cufflinks package (7.), gffread, was used to convert the downloaded annotation file from gff3 to gf3 form using the (-T) flag. Gffread was then used to build a transcriptome file in fasta format from the gtf annotation file and the reference genome (-g option). Kallisto's index function was used to generate an index file from the transcriptome. Kallisto's quant function was used to quantify transcript abundance for each sample with three threads (-t) and 100 bootstrap samples (-b). Results from kallisto can be found in the Kallisto directory. Sleuth (9.) was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The script used for sleuth analysis can be found in the Scripts folder. A likelyhood ratio test (LRT) was preformed to identify differentially expressed genes using a 'full' and 'reduced' model. Significant results (qval <= 0.05) were saved in a tab delineated file (.tab). A qval is an false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted threshold using the benjamini-hochberg procedure. A Wald test was then preformed to generate a beta statistic for differentially expressed genes identified by the LRT. The beta statistic approximates the fold change in expression between the two conditions (biofilm and planktonic).

### Functional analysis

Protein products for the identified differentially expressed genes were found using the gff3 annotation file. Gene function was identified through the BioCyc database (10.) under the *A. Baumannii ACTT 17978* entry.

## Results 

Fastqc analysis of the RNA-seq datasets identified the need for read trimming with Sickle (Figures 1-4). The data sets were determined to be acceptable for downstream analysis post trimming. Detailed results of reads kept are shown in Table 2.

Kallisto was used to quantify gene abundance for each sample using the reference sequence and annotation file with NCBI accession id NC_009085.1. Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) between sample transcript abundances was preformed to measure the linear relationship between samples (Table 3). All samples showed high correlation but planktonic and biofilm samples showed the highest correlation between replicates as expected.

After verifying that transcript abundance was computed correctly, Sleuth was used to identify differentially expressed genes using the Kallisto output. After preforming a likely hood ratio test there were 103 genes identified as being differentially expressed (qval <= 0.05). A Wald test was preformed to quantify a biased fold change for each differentially expressed gene. There were 61 down regulated and 42 up regulated genes in biofilm vs planktonic cells. Gene products were found using the annotation file from the reference genome (NC_009085.1). Gene functions were found using the BioCyc database for *A. Baumannii ACTT 17978*. Table 4 shows all upregulated genes and table 5 shows all down regulated genes. A negative fold change indicates up regulation in Biofilm cells.

## Discussion

The development of multiple drug resistant strains of *A. Baumannii* has been identified as a serious public health threat. Patients infected with this opportunistic pathogen face a potentially deadly outcome and the avenues for treatment are running thin. Novel therapeutics are needed to deal with the current situation. The goal of this study was to increase our understanding of which genes are involved in biofilm formation. These biofilm covered cell colonies pose a large health risk as they are inherently more resilient and resistant to antimicrobial treatments than their planktonic counterparts. Quantification of RNA transcript levels can give insight into which genes are being transcribed and ultimately what proteins are being produced. Until recently transcriptome wide quantification was not feasible. With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms these data sets are becoming available for analysis. Using NGS RNA-Seq data sets from planktonic and biofilm covered cells we performed differential expression analysis and identified genes potentially involved in biofilm formation.

We were able to identify 103 genes that showed statistically significant differences in expression levels between the two conditions (qval <= 0.05). 42 of these genes were markedly up regulated in biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells. 10 of the up regulate genes were involved with ribosomal proteins. The formation of biofilms involves a large amount of protein production which may explain why many of the up regulated genes we discovered were involved with ribosomal production. A1S_3056 showed a 1.2 fold increase and is involved in catalyzing DNA transcription into RNA. This may be an important gene for biofilm production as it could be involved in the up regulation of many other genes. 

We also identified 62 down regulated genes in biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells. Many of these genes were ribosomal RNA's. This was interesting because the data set was supposed to be purified for mRNA. This discovery presents a possible problem with library preparation, sequencing error or downstream analysis. For this reason we believe additional analysis with other differential analysis tools such as cufflinks may be necessary to identify whether these genes were actually present in the data set or the result of faulty analysis.

We hope that the identified genes in this study can be used to aid future research into the mechanisms by which biofilms form in *A. Baummanii* cells. We suggest further downstream functional analysis of the genes presented this study to identify metabolic pathways that could be targeted by novel therapeutics.
